Here's an example of a basic folder structure for a PHP MVC application with image upload and markdown support:

bash
Copy code
/app
    /controllers
        HomeController.php
        ImageController.php
    /models
        ImageModel.php
        MarkdownModel.php
    /views
        home
            index.php
        image
            upload.php
/public
    /uploads
        /images
    /css
    /js
/system
    Controller.php
    Model.php
    View.php
index.php
The /app directory contains the main application logic.
The /controllers directory contains the controllers for the different parts of the application. In this example, there are two controllers: HomeController and ImageController.
The /models directory contains the models for the different parts of the application. In this example, there are two models: ImageModel and MarkdownModel.
The /views directory contains the views for the different parts of the application. In this example, there are two views: home/index.php and image/upload.php.
The /public directory contains public assets, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files. In this example, there is a subdirectory /uploads/images for storing uploaded images.
The /system directory contains the base classes for the MVC pattern, including Controller, Model, and View.
The index.php file serves as the entry point for the application and sets up the basic environment and includes the necessary files.
